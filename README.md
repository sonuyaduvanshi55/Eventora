# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Eventora

**Eventora** is a full-stack event management platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It connects clients with vendors for informal events such as weddings, birthdays, engagements, and more. Clients can book services, manage events, and receive personalized recommendations powered by machine learning.

This project is being developed as a **final-year academic submission** with real-world deployment goals and startup potential.
